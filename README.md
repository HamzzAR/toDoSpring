# toDoSpring
## Introduction
Using a technology stack of:
* MySQL
* Spring Boot
* Angular 8

We implemented a simple todo CRUD. We were given a week to learn and deploy our API.

## Prerequisites
* MySQL database service (with a database setup in relation to src/main/resources/application.yaml)
* Maven build tool for Java
* npm
* node
## Instructions
1) git clone https://github.com/HamzzAR/toDoSpring (or download .zip)
2) Start your MySQL service
3) Navigate to the directory src/main/resources/todo-list
4) Run ```npm install```
5) Run ```ng serve```
6) Return to the root directory of the project
7) Run ```mvn install```
8) Go to target and run ```java -jar ToDoList-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar```
9) Open ```localhost:4200``` in your browser.
